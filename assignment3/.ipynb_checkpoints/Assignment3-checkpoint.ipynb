    "The objective of this assignment is to implement loopy belief propagation, and mean-field method for the Ising model, which we saw last time. Below is a review from the last assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ising model\n",
    "The Ising model is fully expressed using a symmetric adjacency matrix $A$ (```adj```):\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  p(x) = \\frac{1}{Z} \\exp(\\sum_{i} A_{i,i}x_i + \\sum_{i,j < i} x_i A_{i,j}x_j) \\quad x_i \\in \\{-1,+1\\}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "In words, the diagonal of $A$ represents the local field and interactions are captured by the remaining non-zero elements of $A$ (It is customary to have a negative sign in front of the summation, but for simplicity we dropped it.)\n",
    "The graph structure can also be inferred from the sparsity patter of $A$.\n",
    "Here, we are interested in deterministic sum-product inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 1.  Loopy Belief Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.a. (10 pts) \n",
    "Complete the implementation of loopy-BP below. (The base ```Inference``` class as well as ```CliqueTreeInference``` are included in the ```inference.py``` helper file.) \n",
    "Recall that the BP message $m_{i \\to j}$ for a pairwise MRF is the product of all incoming messages, and the relevant factors, marginalized over $x_i$. For the Ising model this is:\n",
    "\\begin{align} \n",
    "m_{i \\to j}(x_j) \\propto (1-\\alpha) m^{old}_{i \\to j}(x_j) \\, + \\, \\alpha \\sum_{x_i \\in \\{-1,+1\\}} \\left ( \\exp(x_i A_{i,i} + x_i A_{i,j} x_j) \\prod_{k \\in Nb(i)-j} m_{k \\to i}(x_i) \\right )\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ called the damping factor helps with the convergence. After convergence the marginals are:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "p(x_i) \\propto \\exp(x_i A_{i,i}) \\prod_{j \\in Nb(i)} m_{j \\to i}(x_i)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the implementation below:\n",
    "Try to use only a single loop, which runs for a maximum of ```self.max_iters```. If you find this too challenging you can also loop over individual messages.\n",
    "The iterations should terminate as soon as the maximum change in the absolute value of the marginals in two iterations goes below ```self.eps```. To help with convergence you can damp (smoothed) your message update using the damping parameter ```self.damping``` \n",
    "\n",
    "#### using log-ratio of messages\n",
    "When dealing with a binary domain, it is more efficient to only track a single probability value (rather two values for the message $m_{i \\to j}(-1), m_{i \\to j}(+1)$ in the case of Ising model. Because this is redundant.) In fact, for numerical stability, it is convenient to track only the log-ratio $\\mu_{i \\to j} = \\log \\left( \\frac{m_{i \\to j}(+1)}{m_{i \\to j}(-1)} \\right )$. One could then try and rewrite the message update using $\\mu$ rather original $m$. This enables us to only track $\\mu$, and after convergence produce marginals using these log-ratios. we can also write the marginals for this setting. For this you need to substitute $m(1) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\mu}} = \\sigma(\\mu)$ and $m(-1) = 1 - \\sigma(\\mu)$ in the update equation above and simplify (if you decide __not__ to use log-ratios you may need to update other parts of the code below, which was written based on this assumption)\n",
